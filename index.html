    <p>I started my IT career as a Help Desk technician after obtainnig my Associates of Computer Science in Cybersecurity at ECPI University in 2016.
        After getting my degree, I discovered that aside from CyberSecurity, there were options to explore and nurture my overall love of building and that's how I discovered Programming.
       Programming was something that was touched on briefly during my time in school, so i started to self-teach myself Python as it's used in the Security realm to automate scans and other processes.
